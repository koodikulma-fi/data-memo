// - Create data trigger - //

/** Create a data memo.
 * - Usage:
 *      1. First define the (optional but often used) onMount callback to be triggered on memory change.
 *      2. Then define create a trigger: `const myTrigger = createDataTrigger(onMount, memory)`.
 *      3. Then later in repeatable part of code call the trigger: `const didChange = myTrigger(newMemory);`
 * - Aboute triggering:
 *      - When calling the trigger you have actually 3 arguments: `(newMemory: Memory, forceRun?: boolean, newOnMountIfChanged?: DataTriggerOnMount<Memory>) => boolean`
 *      - The forceRun forces triggering, while the newOnMountIfChanged sets a new onMount callback, but only if memory was changed (or forced the trigger).
 * - About arguments:
 *      @param onMount Defines a callback to run when the memory has changed.
 *          - If the callback returns another callback, it will be called if the onMount callback gets replaced - see the 3rd arg upon triggering above.
 *      @param memory Defines the initial memory.
 *      @param depth Defines the comparison depth for comparing previous and new memory - to decide whether to run onMount callback.
 *          - Defaults to 1 meaning will perform a shallow comparison on the old and new memory. (By default assumes it's an object.)
 *

 *      * To control the level of comparsion, pass in the optional last arg for "depth". Defaults to 0: identity check on each argument (+ checks argment count).
 * - The producer callback directly receives the arguments returned by the extractor, and it should return the output data solely based on them (other sources of data should be constant).
 * - The whole point of this abstraction, is to trigger the presumably expensive producer callback only when the cheap extractor func tells there's a change.

/** Create a cached data source (returns a function).
 * - Just like createDataSource but provides multiple sets of extraction and data memory.
 * - The key (string) for caching is derived by the 3rd argument which is a function that receives the source arguments: `(...origArgs, cached): string`.
 *      * The cached extra argument provides the dictionary of current caching. The function may also use it to mutate the cache manually, eg. to delete keys from it.
 * - The reason why you would use the "cached" variant is when you have multiple similar use cases for the same selector with different source datas.
 *      * For example, let's say you have 2 similar grids but with two different source data.
 *      * If you would use createDataSource they would be competing about it.
 *      * So in practice, the producer callback would be triggered every time the _asker changes_ - even if data in both sets would stay identical.
 *      * To solve this, you simply define unique keys for each use case. For example: "grid1" and "grid2" in our simple example here.
 * - Like in createDataSource the optional last argument "depth" can be used to define the level of comparison for each argument. Defaults to 0: identity check.
