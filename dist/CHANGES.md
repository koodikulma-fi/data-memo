## v1.0.2

### Added aliases
- Added alias `createMemo` for `createDataMemo` and likewise `createTrigger` for `createDataTrigger`. (They are now the preferred names.)

## v1.0.1

### Updated bundling
- Simply updated the bundling output JS code to be slightly more descriptive, though this also increases the compiled size a bit.
- Shorted the name of `CompareDataDepth` (`Enum` and `Type`) to `CompareDepth` base.
